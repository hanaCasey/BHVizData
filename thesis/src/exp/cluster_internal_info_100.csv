The cluster delves into specific art movements, such as the Renaissance as seen from the South ('Rinascimento visto da Sud'), the denied masterpieces ('Capolavori negati'), and the cosmic symbolism of religious monuments ('Il simbolismo cosmico dei monumenti religiosi'). It touches upon the Order of St. John in Malta, the ever-evolving museum landscapes ('Verso un nuovo museo'), and the intertwining of art with the language of politics. Significant attention is given to the influence of humanism on manuscript illumination in Renaissance Italy, and the art of European courts, specifically Spain's, in the 18th century. The cluster also focuses on the architectural developments inspired by figures like Ruskin, and the intimate relation of art to cities like Venice and their historic biennales. The heritage of Italy, from the Capitoline Collections to the churches of Montefollonico, is explored alongside the deep history of religious iconography and Jewish historiography. Contributions of artistry from other cultures, such as Chinese art ('Cina') and the Hindu temple ('Il tempio induista'), reflect the breadth of the collection. Lastly, the cluster includes scholarly works on individual artists like Giacometti and Rubens, and it revisits classic biographies such as ""Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori"". This cluster is a testament to the intricate web of art, religion, history, and culture that shapes our understanding of European heritage."
