22.03.2023: Meeting with Klaus Werner and Dario, email to the library to get shelf number. Started extraction from json files. Using chatgbt to find regex and formatting the json into csv. 
 
23.03.2023: conversion from json to csv, json file not correct, Klaus Werner provided another file format. Started conversion from new json to csv

27.03.2023: first mapping using umap. Golo Maurer made a comment about the empty space in the middle of the vizualisation and said: "This is where we need to buy more books".

28.03.2023: Meeting with Sabine, asked her for an sql output of four columns (bvb, bh, inventarnummer, date of acquisition). 

29.03.2023: noticed that the year column in messy. Tried to clean it but have to discuss maybe also with the library people what to do with wrong entries that I find. First run of Umap on the entire collection

05.04.23: Found a way to extract information directly from MARC file. Processing it as xml or json not possible. 

06.04.23: Started extraction of signatures from marc files. LOD field is a connection between aleph and opac? 

07.04.23: Signatures extracted. Decoding the website containing the signatures and subjects proves very difficult, because it has wrong level descriptions. 

12.04.23: Signatures extracted and translated. However only 60'000 books have a valid signature according to the list that I have. Excel sheet with signature to text found by talking to Michael Schmitz. A lot of data cleaning necessary.

18.04.23: Meeting with Golo Maurer and Pavla Langer: no full digital list of the signatures exist. Martin Raspe takes care of a database of all the newly added entries (called SyCa)
